Step 8: Verify Demo Setup

    http://192.168.1.16:5000/about -> You should see an EpochEDU version string with the changes currently deployed on your server.
    From the teacher tablet, go to http://192.168.1.16:5000/teacher .  You should see a list of classrooms matching the list of folders created on the USB drive.  If you don't see these folders, or you see other folders with odd names, there is a problem loading your USB flash drive.  Please contact support dkords@razortooth.biz for help debugging and revisit step #1b.  Click into a classroom.  Verify the content is available in the classroom.
    From the student tablet(s), got to http://192.168.1.16:5000/student.  As in the previous step, you should see the proper classrooms configured.

    On Tablet Student Devices: Go to SL4A -> Scripts -> demoreset.py.  Power cycle your tablet can often clear up wifi issues and any odd things happening with the Android browser.
    On Server: Easiest way is to reboot the devices.
